Generate Pre-signed Offline Auto-compound Transactions
by StakeGlmr.com

The app is live from this repo at
https://diversified-validator-network.github.io/?me=YOUR_MOOONBEAM_ADDRESS

This app produces multiple signed delegator-bond-more transactions for Moonbeam, given an address, its private key, and desired transaction count. The add does not submit the transactions to the chain.
